        <h4>🔹 What is ASP.NET?</h4>
        <p>ASP.NET is a <strong>web development framework</strong> by Microsoft for
          building <strong>dynamic web applications, APIs, and services</strong> using
          .NET technologies.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>🔹 Key Features</h3>
        <p>✅ <strong>Built on .NET</strong> → Uses C#, F#, VB.NET
          <br>✅ <strong>Supports MVC</strong> → Model-View-Controller for structured applications
          <br>✅ <strong>Razor Pages</strong> → Simpler page-based approach
          <br>✅ <strong>Blazor</strong> → Build UIs using C# (No JavaScript needed)
          <br>✅ <strong>Web APIs</strong> → Easily create RESTful APIs
          <br>✅ <strong>Security</strong> → Built-in authentication &amp; authorization
          <br>✅ <strong>Cross-Platform</strong> → ASP.NET Core runs on <strong>Windows, macOS, and Linux</strong>
          <br>✅ <strong>High Performance</strong> → Optimized for speed &amp; scalability</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>🔹 Versions of ASP.NET</h3>
        <p>1️⃣ <strong>ASP.NET (Classic)</strong> → Runs on .NET Framework (<strong>Windows-only</strong>)
          <br>2️⃣ <strong>ASP.NET Core</strong> → <strong>Modern, Cross-platform, Open-source</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>🔹 Common Use Cases</h3>
        <p>✔ <strong>Web Apps &amp; Websites</strong>
          <br>✔ <strong>RESTful APIs</strong>
          <br>✔ <strong>Real-time Apps</strong> (SignalR)
          <br>✔ <strong>Microservices</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>🔹 Compatibility</h3>
        <p>✅ <strong>Cross-Platform</strong> → ASP.NET Core can now run on multiple
          operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) instead of being limited to Windows
          like before.
          <br>✅ <strong>Docker Support</strong> → You can deploy ASP.NET Core applications
          in <strong>Docker containers</strong>, offering a lightweight and efficient
          alternative to traditional virtual machines.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>🔹 Performance Improvements</h3>
        <h3>🔹 Performance Improvements</h3>
        <p>🚀 <strong>Faster Execution</strong> → .NET Core is significantly quicker
          than the old .NET Framework.
          <br>🚀 <strong>Asynchronous Programming</strong> → Supports <strong>async/await</strong> for
          better handling of parallel operations, reducing freezing and increasing
          responsiveness.
          <br>🚀 <strong>Better Web Server Performance</strong> → Enhanced request handling
          and processing efficiency.
          <br>🚀 <strong>Threading &amp; Concurrency</strong> → ASP.NET Core optimizes
          resource usage by managing multiple tasks efficiently, preventing race
          conditions and starvation issues.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>🔹 Advanced Features</h3>
        <h3>🔹 Advanced Features</h3>
        <p>✅ <strong>Dependency Injection (DI)</strong> → Now built-in by default,
          whereas previously, external libraries were needed.
          <br>✅ <strong>Improved Security</strong> → <strong>HTTPS</strong> usage is enforced
          more effectively.
          <br>✅ <strong>Pipelines Support</strong> → For better request handling and middleware
          management.
          <br>✅ <strong>Blazor WebAssembly &amp; Blazor Server</strong> → Allows creating
          interactive UIs using C#, similar to <strong>Angular</strong>.
          <br>✅ <strong>WebSockets &amp; Behavior Handling</strong> → SignalR optimizes <strong>real-time interactions</strong> but
          may introduce <strong>latency issues</strong> depending on the network conditions.</p>
